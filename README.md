# ![icon](Droplet/static/icon.png) Droplet
A simple TCP-based LAN-only messaging system. Short and simple, realtime only, decentralized.
Uses UDP for discovery (broadcasting on every interface). If you message someone who have not discovered you, their instance of droplet will automatically discover you for a short while.

Works on port 2999 and needs both TCP (messaging) and UDP (discovery) going. 
Not working? Check out your firewall... first culprit!

# Usage
Simply start droplet and right click on the tray icon to see who else you can reach. They also need to have droplet running and to reach out to you while you reach out to them.
